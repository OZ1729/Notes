### Process of implementing script
Can either write the script using an external application, save the file, and then call the script from the terminal or use nano and do everthing inside the terminal. Nano is much more streamlined. 
The basic structure of this is to create variables to hold the different outputs and then calling each desired function to store the data into the variable and then calling each variable to display the results in the terminal. All of the above listed resources have a wealth of information on how to do this and much more.
