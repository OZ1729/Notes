### What is Kubernetes?
Introduced by group of Google developers in 2014, later donated as an open source project. It is a containeriazation platform.
* *Containers are similar to virtual machines in that they virtualize and provision a computer's resources but they are much smaller and can last for small amounts of time.

Kubernetes manages and provisions containers and can automatically restart failed containers, remove containers, release updates, and continuously monitor container health. Also can control storage locations and make changes to clusters of containers.
* * Can utilize IP and DNS to manage 

Kubernetes can also be used to manage sensitive information such as SSH keys, passowrds and other information.

Kubernetes is known as a modular master node system.

### DPSM Whitepaper
DPSM is designed to break down complex problems into simpler, smaller tasks that lead to sovling the problem. Can use sequence diagrams such as a UML to visualize and illustrate the steps needed to solve the problem. 
With this method, the conclusion is usually the starting point and you work backwards to identify the contributing factors and try to pin down the root cuase and then determine the solution(s). 
Once the problem is broken down into sections, then the sections can be solved to step through the issue.
Foundational knowledge in many different areas can be useful and required for some problems.
